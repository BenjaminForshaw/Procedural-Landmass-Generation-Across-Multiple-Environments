# Procedural-Landmass-Generation Across Multiple Environments

This project is built on Sebastian Lague's "Procedural-Landmass-Generation" [(Repository)](https://github.com/SebLague/Procedural-Landmass-Generation)

I have altered the project to allow the Perlin Noise to generate various 'Regions' which can blend with and contrast one another. 

The 'detail' of regions increases as the player approaches them, and decreases as they move away. Regions are also hidden when outside a render distance, saving on resources.

The amount of regions is scalable, allowing for increased complexity if further developed.
